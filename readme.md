## HOW THE MASKS WORK (FUNCTIONALITIES)
- 1. First click Allow when the pop-up menus shows up in order go grant the video access of your laptop. 
- 2. When you click Edit Mode On, it will allow you to create your own face mask by toggling the mouse cursors. After drawing your own mask, then click Edit Mode Off. The drawings that you created while edit mode was on will trace your face movements. 
- 3. Along with the manual masks created by the user in Step 2, this interface also allows to display masks that are stored in .json file. To use this feature, simply drag the and drop json file that store the mask data. (For this assignment, there are three masks that are available for users to drag and drop to this interface (download these json files from the 'drawings' folder): Pumpkin mask, Ghost mask, and Guard mask). 

## MASK 1: PUMPKIN MASK & GHOST MASK
- The inspiration of these masks are from the recent Halloween. I aimed to create masks that would cover/transform the users' face into pumpkin or ghost. 
- Please refer to Part 3 of the Functionalities in order to display the pumpkin mask and ghost mask. 
- Please refer to 'pumpkin_simulation.gif' & 'ghost_simulation.gif' to see the samples of these masks. 
- GHOST

## MASK 2: SQUID GAME MASK
- The inspiration of this guard mask is from one of the popular Netflix series "Squid Game". I aimed to create Squid Game masks for the users. 
- Please refer to Part 3 of the Functionalities in order to display the guard mask. 
- Please refer to 'squid+game_simulation.gif' to see the samples of these masks.
